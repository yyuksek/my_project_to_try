git push origin <yourbranchname> // push the commit in your branch to your new GitHub repo

git checkout <branch_name> // switch to branch called branch_name

A hash code is a unique identifier for that specific commit. It's useful for referring to specific commits and when undoing changes (use the git revert <hash code number> command to backtrack).

the commit you made in your branch and merged into the master branch doesn't exist in the master branch on your local machine. In order to get the most recent changes that you or others have merged on GitHub, use the git pull origin master command 

git push origin <yourbranchname> // push the commit in your branch to your new GitHub repo
git push git@github.com:git/git.git yourbranchname//same as the above command, the above has the alias "origin"
